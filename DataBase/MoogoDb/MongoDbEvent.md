### 🔍 Explanation

* `mongoose.connection`: Refers to the **current connection** to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
* `.on('connected', ...)`: Listens for the **`connected` event**, which is triggered **when the connection to MongoDB is successfully established**.
* `() => console.log("Database Connected")`: This is the **callback function** that runs when the connection is successful — it simply logs `"Database Connected"` to the console.

### 🧠 In Simple Terms:

It’s telling Mongoose:
👉 "When the MongoDB database connection is successful, print **'Database Connected'** in the terminal."
