Here's an updated section you can **add to your GitHub `README.md`** to explain what `react-router-dom` is, why it's used, and how it's applied in your project.

### 📚 What is `react-router-dom`?

`react-router-dom` is a **library for routing in React applications**. It enables navigation between different pages or views in a single-page app (SPA) without a full page reload.

It helps developers create **multi-page experiences** with URLs like `/`, `/about`, `/dashboard`, etc., while staying in a single React app.

---

### 🔧 Why use `react-router-dom`?

* ✅ Define different "pages" using components
* ✅ Navigate between pages with `<Link>` instead of `<a>`
* ✅ Conditionally render components based on URL
* ✅ Handle nested routing (e.g. `/dashboard/settings`)
* ✅ Prevent full-page reloads with client-side routing

### 🛣️ Basic Example

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import About from "./pages/About";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

In this example:

* `BrowserRouter` wraps the entire app and enables routing.
* `Routes` holds all route definitions.
* `Route` maps a path (like `/about`) to a component (`<About />`).

### 🧭 Navigation Example

Use the `<Link>` component for navigating between routes:

```jsx
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link to="/about">About</Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

### 📦 Install it

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

> Version used: React Router DOM v6+

Let me know if you want to include advanced features like route protection (`PrivateRoute`), nested routes, or dynamic routes (`/user/:id`) in the README too!
