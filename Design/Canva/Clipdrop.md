### 🎯 Who It’s Best For

* **Content creators & e-commerce sellers** who need quick product shots with clean backgrounds.
* **Designers & marketers** wanting fast image edits (upscaling, relighting, background swaps).
* **Anyone who snaps real-world objects** and wants them neatly cut out, enhanced, and ready for use.

### ⚙️ Considerations

* Free tier has usage limits, and Pro subscription is worth it only if you’re regularly editing high-res images.
* It’s less suited for advanced photographers—those may prefer dedicated editing suites—but it’s a super-efficient tool for many everyday visual tasks.
