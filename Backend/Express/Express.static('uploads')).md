```js
app.use("/images", express.static('uploads'));
```

This line is from an **Express.js server**, and it’s used to serve **static files (like images)**.

## ✅ **What does it do?**

This tells Express:

> “Any request to `/images/...` should serve files from the `uploads/` folder on the server.”

### 🧱 Breakdown of Components

#### 🔹 `app.use(path, middleware)`

* A method in Express to add middleware functions
* Here, it's used to define a static file handler

#### 🔹 `express.static('uploads')`

* Built-in Express middleware
* Makes files in the `uploads` directory publicly accessible

#### 🔹 `"/images"`

* Acts as a **virtual route** or **URL prefix**

---

### 🧠 What happens when a request is made?

If someone visits:

```http
http://yourdomain.com/images/pic.jpg
```

Then Express will look for:

```bash
/uploads/pic.jpg
```

> So `/images/abc.png` maps to `uploads/abc.png` on your disk.

## 🧪 Example

### 📁 Folder Structure:

```
project/
├── server.js
├── uploads/
│   ├── profile.jpg
```

### 📜 Code in `server.js`:

```js
import express from "express";
const app = express();

app.use("/images", express.static('uploads'));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

### 🔗 Access:

Now you can access:

```http
http://localhost:3000/images/profile.jpg
```

Even though `uploads/` is not in the `public/` directory, Express will **still serve it** via `/images` because of the middleware.

---

## 🔒 Security Tip

* Make sure the `uploads` folder only contains **safe files**.
* Avoid serving sensitive or executable content.
* For user uploads, **validate file types** (e.g., allow only images).
