### 🔧 Code:

```js
generationConfig: {
  temperature: 0.2,
}
```

### 🔍 Meaning of `temperature`:

* **`temperature`** controls the **randomness** or **creativity** of the model’s output.
* It is a **float between 0 and 1** (or sometimes even higher).

### 💡 How `temperature` works:

| Temperature | Behavior                                   | Example Description                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `0.0`       | **Deterministic** (same output every time) | Always picks the most likely next word |
| `0.2`       | **Low randomness** (slightly creative)     | More focused, safer, less variation    |
| `0.7`       | **Medium randomness**                      | More diverse output                    |
| `1.0`       | **High randomness**                        | Very creative, more surprising         |

So in your case:

---

### ✅ `temperature: 0.2`

* The model will generate **precise, reliable, and predictable responses**.
* It's great for tasks where you want **consistency**, like:

  * Code generation
  * Answering factual questions
  * Summarization
