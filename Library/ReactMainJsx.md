import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App.jsx";
import "./index.css";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### ✅ Terminal commands (just in case you need them)

Install required dependencies if not already:

```bash
npm install react react-dom react-router-dom
```

If you’re using Vite (you likely are), to run the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Let me know if you want me to add routes to `App.jsx` or explain `BrowserRouter` usage in more depth!
