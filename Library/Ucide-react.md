## 🗂️ Recommended Folder Structure (Optional)

You can organize reusable icons in a central file if you use many icons:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar.jsx
│   └── ...
├── icons/                      # ✅ Icon wrapper folder
│   └── index.js
└── App.jsx
```

```js
// icons/index.js
export { Home, User, Settings } from "lucide-react";
```

```jsx
// in components/Navbar.jsx
import { Home, User } from "../icons";
```
