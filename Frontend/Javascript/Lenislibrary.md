**Lenis** is a modern **smooth scroll library** for web development, primarily used in JavaScript-based front-end projects. It provides buttery-smooth scrolling with customizable effects and is especially useful for enhancing user experience in visually-rich or interactive websites.

## üîç What is Lenis?

Lenis is a **lightweight JavaScript library** built for **smooth and customizable scroll animations**. Developed by **Studio Freight**, it replaces the native browser scroll with a custom one, enabling:

* consistent behavior across all browsers
* frame-synced scroll events
* advanced control over scroll velocity, easing, and behavior

## ‚úÖ Key Features

* **Smooth scrolling**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` to create fluid motion.
* **Scroll normalization**: Same scroll feel across devices and browsers.
* **Scroll control**: Easily pause, start, stop scroll programmatically.
* **GSAP integration**: Compatible with GSAP and other animation libraries.
* **Supports scroll triggers**: Useful for scroll-based effects or animations.

## üì¶ Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install @studio-freight/lenis
```

Or use a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@studio-freight/lenis"></script>
```

## üß† Basic Usage Example (JavaScript)

```js
import Lenis from '@studio-freight/lenis'

const lenis = new Lenis()

function raf(time) {
  lenis.raf(time)
  requestAnimationFrame(raf)
}

requestAnimationFrame(raf)
```

> You typically wrap your scroll animations inside `raf()` (request animation frame) to ensure they‚Äôre synced with Lenis‚Äôs scrolling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases

### 1. **Creative Websites & Portfolios**

* Great for designers, artists, and agencies wanting a premium feel.
* Adds fluid scroll that feels better than default browser scroll.

### 2. **Scroll-triggered Animations**

* Works seamlessly with libraries like **GSAP ScrollTrigger**.
* Smooth scrolling helps prevent jittery or misaligned triggers.

### 3. **Parallax Effects**

* Lenis makes parallax smoother and more predictable.

### 4. **Controlling Scroll Behavior**

* Temporarily disable scroll (e.g., during modals).
* Add scroll to elements, not just the window (custom containers).

## üí° Code with GSAP ScrollTrigger Example

```js
import Lenis from '@studio-freight/lenis'
import gsap from 'gsap'
import ScrollTrigger from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger'

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)

const lenis = new Lenis()

lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update)

gsap.ticker.add((time) => {
  lenis.raf(time * 1000)
})
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Keep in Mind

* Lenis **replaces native scroll**, so some default browser behaviors (like anchor links) may need special handling.
* Ensure layout compatibility if your website uses full-page sections or sticky headers.
* If using with frameworks (e.g., React, Next.js, Vue), consider wrapping it inside `useEffect` or lifecycle methods.
