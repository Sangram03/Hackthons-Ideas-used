### What is ECMAScript (ECMA JS)?

**ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES)** is a **standardized scripting language** specification created by **ECMA International**, primarily serving as the **standard for JavaScript**. In simple terms, **JavaScript follows ECMAScript standards** to ensure consistency and compatibility across different environments (like browsers and servers).

---

### 📜 Origin

* **JavaScript** was initially developed by **Brendan Eich** at **Netscape** in 1995.
* In 1997, to **standardize** JavaScript, **Netscape** submitted it to **ECMA International**, resulting in the first edition of **ECMAScript (ECMA-262)**.
* Now, multiple versions (ES5, ES6, ES7...) are published and maintained.

---

### 🔧 Why ECMAScript Matters

* Ensures **uniformity** of JavaScript across all browsers.
* Defines the **core language features** of JavaScript (syntax, types, operators, objects, functions, etc.).
* Helps browser makers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) implement consistent JS engines.

### 🧠 ECMAScript vs JavaScript

| ECMAScript                           | JavaScript                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| A **language specification**         | A **programming language** that follows ECMAScript   |
| No real implementation               | Implemented by engines like **V8**, **SpiderMonkey** |
| Defines how JavaScript should behave | Adds APIs (like DOM) not defined in ECMAScript       |

### 🔄 Major ECMAScript Versions

#### ✅ ES5 (2009)

* Strict Mode (`"use strict"`)
* Array methods: `forEach`, `map`, `filter`
* JSON support

#### 🚀 ES6 / ES2015 (Game Changer)

* `let`, `const` (block scope variables)
* Arrow functions: `() => {}`
* Classes
* Template literals: `` `Hello ${name}` ``
* Destructuring: `const { name } = obj`
* Promises
* Modules (`import/export`)

#### ✨ ES7 and Beyond

* **ES7 / ES2016**: `Array.prototype.includes`, `**` exponentiation
* **ES8 / ES2017**: `async/await`
* **ES9 / ES2018**: Spread in objects, asynchronous iteration
* **ES10 / ES2019**: `flat`, `flatMap`, optional catch binding
* **ES11 / ES2020**: Nullish coalescing `??`, Optional chaining `?.`
* **ES12 / ES2021**: `String.replaceAll`, logical assignment `||=`
* **... continues yearly**

### 🔍 Real-Life Examples

```js
// ES5
var name = "John";
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

// ES6+
let name = "John";
const greet = () => console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
```

### 📦 JS Engines That Implement ECMAScript

* **V8** – Chrome & Node.js
* **SpiderMonkey** – Firefox
* **JavaScriptCore** – Safari
* **Chakra (old)** – Internet Explorer

---

### 🧪 How ECMAScript Evolves

Each year, **TC39 (Technical Committee 39)** reviews and proposes new features. These go through stages (0 to 4), and once finalized, they are added to the ECMAScript standard.

---

### Summary

* **ECMAScript = the rules/spec of JavaScript.**
* **JavaScript = implementation of ECMAScript** + web APIs (DOM, fetch, etc.)
* New features in JavaScript are guided and standardized through **ECMAScript editions**.
